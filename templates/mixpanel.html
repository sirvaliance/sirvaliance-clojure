                <h2>Why Mixpanel?</h2>
                <p>After viewing the job posting on HN, I was intrigued to find an opening for such an interesting position.  Typically I work as a web developer and hack on anonymity code, but I also fill the role of a community manager.  I would love to move to San Francisco and seeing that you offer relocation assistance, I figured I should give it a go. </p>

            <h2>What Do I Currently Do?</h2>
            <p>I currently work as a Freelance web developer and operate as the Founder of <a href="https://crypto.is">The Crypto Project</a>.  As part of The Crypto Project, I maintain the website and services as well as act as an administrator to the network.  My freelance work is primarily focused on Web Developement, Design, and Server Administration.</p>

                <h2>Why This Position?</h2>
                <p>I have been a reader of HN for years now and I would love to be part of a YC company. I am great with meeting, talking to, and interacting with people, particularly those I have never met.  I have starup experience and have worked in small teams and freelanced with startups. Seeing that you work primarily with Python and Javascript (which is what I prefer as well), I believe I could be a great link between customer issues and the engineering team.  </p>

                <h2>Why Me?</h2>
                <p>I am a jack of all trades and a master of many.  I understand the full stack of web development, and feel as though I am language agnostic.  You could put me in front of any framework, language, or server setup, and I will produce great results in as short as a timeframe as possible.  I believe that with that requisite knowledge, I could help identify customer issues quickly and efficiently.  Let me tell you more about my most recent work. </p>

From the website, &#8220;The Crypto Project is an organization designed to assist and encourage anonymity and encryption research, development, and use&#8221;.  The project has 4 goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>Building a website that becomes an authoritative, reliable, and current resource for those learning how to achieve privacy, security, and anonymity.</li>
                    <li>Bringing the security, cryptography, and development communities together to work on projects, discuss ideas, and unite to create progress.</li>

                    <li>Create, assist in creating, promote, and help others use software to achieve privacy, security, and anonymity.</li>

We consistently have 60-80 members in the IRC chatroom discussing, collaborating, and working on various projects.  We have so many intelligent and friendly contributors and it makes me so proud to say I was a catalyst to make it happen.</p>

            <p class="headline_text">My Work on The Crypto Project</p>
            <div class="grid_5 prefix_1 alpha">
                <p>As the founder, I orginally conceived the idea and designed and built out the website within the span of a day (when I work, I work fast).  I originally built the site using <a href="http://tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a>, but once it became clear we needed a wiki for user contributed content I devised a different architecture.  For visual design and security reasons, I was hesitant to use any of the wiki software out there and decided our best option was to create a repository of Markdown templates.  I forked and modified <a href="https://github.com/sirvaliance/gollum">Gollum</a> for our <a href="https://wiki.crypto.is">Wiki</a>, and subsequently built (hacked together is a better term) a static site generator called <a href="https://github.com/sirvaliance/hoggle">Hoggle</a> to build both our site and <a href="https://blog.crypto.is">blog</a>.  All of our server builds and updates are automated and managed through <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.2.2/index.html">Fabric Scripts</a>.  I am passionate and a strong believer in automating anything that can be automated.  I recently wrote an IRC bot to automate any of the responsibilities that I previously had.  Approved users can trigger site rebuilds, post to the blog, and post tweets all from IRC.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid_5 omega">
                <p>As well as writing and setting up our website, I have set up and work as an administrator to our <a href="https://crypto.is/projects/network/">Network</a>.  In our network, I have setup and operate a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Relay</a>, a <a href="http://mixminion.net/">Mixminion Relay</a>, a <a href="http://convergence.io/">Convergence Notary</a>, a <a href="https://torproject.crypto.is/">TorProject.org Mirror</a>, and have begun work on a <a href="http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs">Tahoe-LAFS</a> grid behind Tor hidden services.  All of our services run behind an Nginx reverse SSL proxy and we like to implement secure features like <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS</a>.</p>
                <p>I am a passionate developer who spends my day's working on open-source code, talking to hacker friends on IRC, and working as an activist for open source software and knowledge, particularly related to privacy, anonymity, and security.  I would love to bring the passion and talent exemplified in current work to Mixpanel!

            <div class="grid_5 prefix_1 alpha">
                <h2>My Research and Bookshelf</h2>
                <p>My current interests are reading and researching security, anonymity, and privacy texts and constantly expanding my knowledge as a developer and creator.  I continually push myself to become better, more efficient, and always search to discover new tools, methodologies, and approaches to the act of creation.</p>
                <p>I have a mini library of authoritative texts on various topics that I am pushing my way through, from SICP to the Dragon book, I hope to get through them all.  I have an interest in remailers and mixnets, and love reading white papers from <a href="http://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/">AnonBib</a>.</p>

                <p>My other passion and hobby is creating music.  I primarily play the guitar as well as other instruments and post my music on the web.  My latest work can be found at my <a href="http://sirvaliance.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp page</a>.  My latest release is a compilation album dedicated to the late <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Len_Sassaman">Len Sassaman</a> (who was someone I looked up to), titled &#8220;A Waltz for Len&#8221;.</p>

After experiencing the pleasure of working regularly with Sir on the Crypto
Project, I can say with great certainty that the only thing which eclipses his
potential as a developer is his drive and personal sacrifice to bring his
project to completion.
